During my twenty-plus years at CSDN, I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the birth, development, and popularization of numerous technologies. Throughout this journey, I've had the fortune to meet many technical experts, some of whom were direct participants in shaping these technologies. Particularly in internet technology development, Chinese technical experts have been keeping pace with global trends.

## The Path of a Programmer

Every programmer, during their development journey, often chooses a specific technical path and delves deep into it to become a technical expert. However, programmers have another career path available: technical management. The challenge of moving into technical management lies not only in management capabilities but also in the breadth of technical knowledge. Only by understanding multiple technical domains can one truly grasp technological trends, formulate technical strategies, and guide company products in the right direction.

## Beyond Specialized Knowledge

Among the numerous technical books available, most focus on specific technologies. For many professionals seeking a broader technical perspective, they either have to gather knowledge through scattered searches or skim through numerous books for a superficial understanding. It was after conducting the "Programmer's Path to Wealth" interview series that I realized we needed something new. I decided to create a series where we would invite experts to discuss the history, current state, and future prospects of various popular technologies. This initiative, which I named "A Brief History of Technology," quickly gained support from colleagues and friends, resulting in over a dozen conversations with dozens of technical expert guests.

## Insights from Expert Dialogues

During my role as host in these conversations, I was frequently moved by the guests' brilliant insights and gained tremendous knowledge. It was particularly fascinating to hear experts describe their personal experiences in technology development, their involvement in standards and products, and how they transformed technology into solutions that created real value. While software technology is incredibly complex and broad, and although our content couldn't cover all domains or delve too deeply into technical discussions, I believe it provides readers with an eye-opening, relatable learning experience. This is especially valuable for computer science students or newcomers to the industry, helping them build a comprehensive framework of software technology rather than immediately diving into coding and becoming mere programmers.

## The Golden Age of Chinese Technology

As a long-time CSDN employee, I've been fortunate to witness China's golden age of software technology development and engage in deep discussions with experts across various technical domains. In recent years, China's internet technology has developed rapidly, with continuous innovation. In cutting-edge areas like cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence, Chinese companies are keeping pace with or even leading global developments.

Companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent have garnered global attention with their investments and innovation speed in AI technology. Startups like ByteDance have achieved world-class status in areas such as short video and recommendation algorithms. It's fair to say that Chinese internet technology companies have emerged as significant players in technical innovation, achieving remarkable success.

## The Flourishing Developer Community

Simultaneously, China's open-source community and developer groups have flourished. Platforms like GitHub and CSDN host millions of technology enthusiasts who organize themselves around various popular technologies, engaging in discussions and code sharing, promoting open-source culture in China. Looking ahead, software technology will continue to transform the world and create new application scenarios in the coming decades, and Chinese software developers will play an increasingly important role, contributing more original technologies and products.

## Looking to the Future

I believe many technical experts featured in these discussions will become key forces driving this technological revolution. Software technology will remain the most powerful driver of social development, and Chinese technical experts, including our readers, are all active participants in this journey. Let's continue to explore and contribute to this evolving narrative of software technology together.

## The Rise of Chinese Innovation

In these years, I've witnessed how Chinese internet technology has developed at an astounding pace, with innovations emerging constantly. In frontier areas such as cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence, Chinese companies are not just keeping pace with the world but sometimes taking the lead. Companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent have attracted global attention with their investment and innovation in artificial intelligence technology. Even startup companies like ByteDance have achieved world-class status in areas like short video and recommendation algorithms. Their technical innovations in these areas have reached world-class levels.

## A Global Perspective

Looking ahead, software technology will continue to transform the world in the coming decades, creating new application scenarios. Chinese software developers will play an increasingly important role in this transformation, contributing more original technologies and products to the global ecosystem. I believe many of the technical experts mentioned in this book will become important forces leading this wave of technological change.
