During my twenty-plus years at CSDN, I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the birth, development, and popularization of numerous technologies. Throughout this journey, I've had the fortune to meet many technical experts, some of whom were direct participants in shaping these technologies. Particularly in internet technology development, Chinese technical experts have been keeping pace with global trends.

## The Path of a Programmer

Every programmer, during their development journey, often chooses a specific technical path and delves deep into it to become a technical expert. However, programmers have another career path available: technical management. The challenge of moving into technical management lies not only in management capabilities but also in maintaining technical depth while broadening one's perspective.

## The Rise of Chinese Internet Technology
