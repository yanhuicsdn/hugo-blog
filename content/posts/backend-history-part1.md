In this comprehensive exploration of backend architecture evolution, we delve into insights from leading Chinese technology experts Zhang Lei, Head of Database Technology at Toutiao, and Zhang Huan, Architect at KeShell FindHouse. Their combined experience provides a unique perspective on the transformation of backend systems from the 1970s to the present day.

## The Foundation Years (1970s-1990s)

The early development of backend architecture was primarily driven by enterprise needs, as Zhang Lei explains: "In the late 1970s and 1980s, hardware and economics dominated the industry. System software was developed by professional programmers for specialized applications, such as traditional banking systems."

### Enterprise-Centric Development
During this period, backend systems were characterized by:
- Centralized architectures running on mainframe computers
- Proprietary operating systems, primarily from IBM
- Limited user base, mostly enterprise clients
- Focus on reliability and data processing capabilities

```java
// Example of early enterprise system architecture
public class BankingSystem {
    private static final Database mainframeDB;
    
    public synchronized void processTransaction(Transaction tx) {
        // Single-threaded processing
        mainframeDB.execute(tx);
        mainframeDB.commit();
    }
}
```

## The Rise of Open Systems

The emergence of open-source operating systems marked a significant shift in backend development. "Linux became the primary development environment," notes Zhang Lei, "leading to the democratization of backend technology and the emergence of enterprise-grade open-source software."

### Key Developments
1. Adoption of standardized protocols
2. Introduction of client-server architecture
3. Development of relational databases
4. Emergence of middleware solutions

## The Monolithic Era

The 1990s saw the dominance of monolithic architectures, which Zhang Huan reflects on: "From the perspective of overall internet backend development, monolithic architecture underwent several evolutionary processes before its limitations became apparent."

### Characteristics of Monolithic Systems

```java
// Traditional monolithic application structure
public class MonolithicApplication {
    private UserService userService;
    private OrderService orderService;
    private InventoryService inventoryService;
    
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Tightly coupled services
        if (userService.validateUser(order.getUserId())) {
            if (inventoryService.checkStock(order.getItems())) {
                orderService.createOrder(order);
                inventoryService.updateStock(order.getItems());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Technical Foundations and Growth

Both experts emphasize the importance of mastering fundamental technologies. Zhang Huan shares: "Engineers need to experience the basic knowledge of language and operating system in the first stage, train deployment and maintenance skills in various environments, including basic network knowledge and bottom-layer technologies."

### Essential Skills for Backend Engineers
1. Operating System Fundamentals
   - Memory management
   - Process scheduling
   - File systems

2. Network Programming
   - TCP/IP protocols
   - Socket programming
   - Network security

3. Database Management
   - SQL optimization
   - Transaction processing
   - Data integrity

```java
// Example of fundamental backend skills
public class NetworkService {
    private ServerSocket serverSocket;
    private ExecutorService threadPool;
    
    public void start() {
        threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
        
        while (true) {
            Socket client = serverSocket.accept();
            threadPool.execute(new ClientHandler(client));
        }
    }
}
```

## The Importance of Continuous Learning

Zhang Lei emphasizes: "Only by being engaged in a particular field for a long time can one truly master the technology of the entire direction. Understanding both the current situation and the development process allows comprehension of the reasons behind considerations, decisions, and transformations throughout the entire technological chain."

## Looking Forward

As we move into the next article in this series, we'll explore how the internet boom and the need for scalability led to the transformation from monolithic to distributed systems. The foundation laid during these early years continues to influence modern backend architecture, with principles of reliability and data consistency remaining as relevant as ever.

The evolution of backend architecture demonstrates the transformation from specialized enterprise systems to more open and flexible architectures. Understanding this history is crucial for developers looking to build the next generation of backend systems.
